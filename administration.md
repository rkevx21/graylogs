By default all terms or phrases are OR connected so all messages that have at least one hit are returned.

```
"ssh login" AND source:example.org 
("ssh login" AND (source:example.org OR source:another.example.org)) OR _exists_:always_find_me

Use ? to replace a single character or * to replace zero or more characters

```
source:*.org
source:exam?le.org

```

**Fuzziness**

```
ssh logni~
source:exmaple.org~
source:exmaple.org~1
"foo bar"~5
```

**Range Queries**

```
http_response_code:[500 TO 504]
http_response_code:{400 TO 404}
bytes:{0 TO 64]
http_response_code:[0 TO 64}
http_response_code:>400
http_response_code:<400
http_response_code:>=400
http_response_code:<=400
http_response_code:(>=400 AND <500)
```

### Escaping

Characters must be escaped with a backslash

```&& || : \ / + - ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ?``` e.g. ```resource:\/posts\/45326```
